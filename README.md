# Unofficial-Uganda-Securities-Exhange-API
The Unofficial Uganda Securities Exchange API to get data from the exchange's website.

1. To Run the Web System, make sure to clone this repo on your computer.
2. Start your xampp/ wamp server / any php server you have running.
3. Open the **PortfolioManager.php** and you can then test out the API features. The API includes functionality for extracting all the companies on the exchange, the company details, the company listing price changes (which may be needed for plotting), then the UGX to USD rate.
4. **Beware** Use of the API for production purposes needs approval from the Uganda Securities Commission, you'll need to visit their website and email them incase you need to use the data from their website.
5. You can re-code it in any language / framework if you so deem necessary.
6. I'm welcome to contributions on how to make it better or any ideas for it's further implementation.
